		<p>This is Emilio V's really cool website. 
		I have a couple projects I have done before below and I think they are pretty neat and I will probably add others that I am proud of.
		<br>(also, just to clarify I did not made Microsoft Rover, he is just a funny dog.) </p>

		<p>This is my Chemotaxis project, I called it Artistic Amoebas. The little amoebas follow your cursor is a random way, 
			always trying to move towards the cursor but with some random movement. You can click to disperse them away from the cursor.
			This is one of my favorites because the patterns it makes have cool layers and watching the amoebas recollect after they are dispersed
			is very satisfying.
